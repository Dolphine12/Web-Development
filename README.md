## üìÑ Project Overview
This repository contains the codebase for a UI Portfolio website that our team built to mirror a demo design we were shown. While faithfully reproducing the original layout and styling, we also added new interactive features and theming options to demonstrate our own contributions and technical skills.

## ü§ù Collaboration
This was a **team effort**. Each member took ownership of specific sections and collaborated via GitHub to merge our work:

- **Branching Strategy**: Each feature or section was developed in its own branch (e.g., `feature/skills-section`, `feature/light-dark-theme`).
- **Pull Requests**: We created PRs for merging into `main`, with code reviews and approvals from at least one teammate.
- **Code Reviews**: We used GitHub‚Äôs review tools to ensure code quality, catch bugs, and maintain consistency.
- **Daily Syncs**: Short stand-up calls or messages to align on progress and resolve merge conflicts quickly.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Languages
- **HTML5** ‚Äî Semantic structure of the webpage.
- **CSS3** ‚Äî Custom styling and responsive layouts.
- **Bootstrap 5** ‚Äî Grid system, components, and utility classes.
- **JavaScript** ‚Äî DOM manipulation, theme toggling, smooth scrolling, and carousel logic.
- **Font Awesome & Bootstrap Icons** ‚Äî Iconography across the site.

## ‚ú® Key Features & Enhancements
1. **Design Replication**  
   We replicated the look and feel of the original demo, including header, hero, portfolio, skills, services, stats, and success-work sections.

2. **Light & Dark Theme Toggle**  
   Added a theme switcher (sun/moon icon) in the navbar to let users switch between light and dark modes‚Äîan enhancement not present in the demo.

3. **About Us Carousel**  
   Implemented a Bootstrap carousel in the About section to display team member profiles one at a time with navigation controls (next/prev).

4. **Responsive Layout**  
   Ensured all sections adapt gracefully to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens using Bootstrap‚Äôs grid and media queries.

5. **Smooth Scrolling & Interactions**  
   JavaScript-enabled smooth scrolling to anchor links and subtle hover animations for images and cards.
